# PlantDoc Image Classification Project TODO

## Project Setup
- [x] Create project structure (data/, src/, notebooks/, models/, reports/)
- [x] Create requirements.txt with necessary libraries
- [x] Create download_data.py to download PlantDoc dataset
- [x] Create preprocess.py for data loading, splitting, augmentation

## Model Implementation
- [x] Create traditional_ml.py for HOG features + SVM
- [x] Create deep_learning.py for ResNet transfer learning
- [x] Create analysis.py for confusion matrix, feature maps, etc.
- [x] Create main.ipynb for experiments and analysis

## Execution
- [ ] Install requirements (failed - no space left on device)
- [ ] Download data (in progress)
- [x] Update preprocessing to use TRAIN/ and TEST/ folders
- [ ] Run preprocessing (requires TensorFlow installation)
- [ ] Train traditional ML model
- [ ] Train deep learning model
- [ ] Perform hyperparameter sensitivity analysis
- [ ] Compare model depths/architectures
- [ ] Test data augmentation effects
- [ ] Conduct ablation studies
- [ ] Perform failure analysis (confusion matrix, confused classes)
- [ ] Visualize model interpretability (feature maps)

## Deliverables
- [ ] Generate test set predictions
- [ ] Write 5-10 page experiment report
- [ ] Prepare source code link (GitHub)
